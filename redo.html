           <br>Uganda is my country.I love Uganda.I am a Ugandan by nationaly and l will always choose Uganda amongest all odds.
    One thing l love about Uganda is it's nature. We have been blessed with the best weather which has given us a green view reflected by the lakes,rivers,mountains,hills and most importantly wildlife.

            I love my country of its nature mostly in the western side of Uganda. <br>
            A district like Kabale has the most beautiful features! The Crater lake made of the different historical islands. <br>
